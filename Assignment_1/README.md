Assignment_1

Process

The project was going to be a system where a QR code would fetch from a server full of different assets of data one to the viewer. It was inspired by QR codes used to assign fluctuating values to SKUs in Supermarkets. 

At the beginning I realized it would be better if I redirect the same logic to a dynamic I saw in class. I wanted to redirect the QR code to establish a database where a professor could get students to submit their names when entering the class in order to establish a time frame for each one to present an assignment. The system would then divide number of students by the time available for them to present X project. 

After getting into the different layers this project would undertake (Front End, Pipelines, Databases, Back End) I decided to kludge in -under the dynamics and logics of the assignment- and developed a second project that delves with the essence of my initial project in a Front End space. 

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I developed a website that would be fetched by a QR code. In the project I not only explored the Front End basic structures but also the design of the brand, its logo and its content. The project name is Gust. And as its about.html says:

Gust creates new currents and networks by sharing projects that span image, sound, text and spatial practices which come from research and derives in the larger periphery limits of the art world.

Gust is an opportunity to get to know and find out about art and creative practices that might have not reached you yet.

Feel free to pass the Gust to who ever you want and share your thoughts and reactions with us!

To explore the capacities and different dynamics of Front End, I explored adding the websites as an inframe of my url, an animation to the beginning, making the button that loads next website alter position randomly when clicked, different pages that ask for content to be send by the user -a Contact and Submit page- and finally an animation page during the loading of the websites.

This last one wasn't finished when the deadline arrived. I designed an Exquisite Corps from the possibilities I explored. This file is in the Assignment_1 folder under homecopy.html. 

I will definitely pursue this project in the future since it is of utmost interest to me.
